I am a PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University, and have worked with the [Gianneschi Group](https://sites.northwestern.edu/gianneschigroup/) since 2018. My work centers on using novel _in situ_ characterization techniques to analyze soft materials, and has been recognized by a number of national and internal fellowships. Lists of publications and more specific research information may be found on the pages, or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-vratsanos-7b9409a5/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=izAX6GoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=2&sortby=pubdate) pages.
