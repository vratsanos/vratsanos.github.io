I am a PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University, and have worked with the [Gianneschi Group](https://sites.northwestern.edu/gianneschigroup/) since 2018. My work centers on using novel _in situ_ characterization techniques to analyze soft materials, and has been recognized by a number of national and internal fellowships. Lists of publications and more specific research information may be found on the pages above.
