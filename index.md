I am a PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University, and have worked with the [Gianneschi Group](https://sites.northwestern.edu/gianneschigroup/) since 2018. My work centers on using novel _in situ_ characterization techniques to analyze soft materials, and has been recognized by a number of national and internal fellowships. Lists of publications and more specific research information may be found on the pages, or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-vratsanos-7b9409a5/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=izAX6GoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=2&sortby=pubdate) pages.

### Research Description
My graduate research focuses on expanding the scope of liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, specifically with regards to soft matter. I have pioneered the direct observation of emulsions and other mixed phase systems, and have used analogous techniques to investigate a variety of industrially-relevant, consumer-facing materials. 

In my undergraduate work, I explored structure-property relationships in polyelectrolyte hydrogels in order to develop a better understanding of how the inclusion of ionic salts affected the polymerization and resulting materials. I was listed as an inventor on the patent for these materials as well. During my various summer internships and REU, I was also involved in projects building biocompatible scaffolds for use in regenerative medicine, both with natural and synthetic materials, through additive manufacturing and microfabrication.
